A faster plotter and a k=32 plot size minimum mean it's time for a new farming contest!

Starting at block *11,325* on the Beta 15 (current) chain we're going to have a farming rewards race to block *13,350*. We will count the winning blocks by counting blocks of k size 32 or greater that are rewarded to a Pool Public Key during this window. If a plot with a k size of less than 32 wins a block, it will be ignored for the purposes of this contest. You can get a proxy of who is [leading](https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/puzzlehashes) over the last 1000 blocks from the community created [Chia Explorer](https://www.chiaexplorer.com/). The official leaderboard will be at [leaderboard.chia.net](https://leaderboard.chia.net/).

We have a broader set of prizes this time.

1. **1st Place** - A 1.6TB [Intel® SSD DC P4610 Series](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/140103/intel-ssd-dc-p4610-series-1-6tb-2-5in-pcie-3-1-x4-3d2-tlc.html) Drive and 3 [Seagate Exos X16 14TB](https://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/exos-x16-DS2011-3-2008US-en_US.pdf) Data Center Enterprise Hard Drives.

2. **2nd Place** -  A [Samsung PM963 960GB M.2 NVMe PCIe](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/global.semi.static/Samsung_PM963-1.pdf) Enterprise SSD and 2 [Seagate Exos X16 14TB](https://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/exos-x16-DS2011-3-2008US-en_US.pdf) Data Center Enterprise Hard Drives.

3. **3rd Place** -  A [Seagate Exos X16 14TB](https://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/exos-x16-DS2011-3-2008US-en_US.pdf) Data Center Enterprise Hard Drive.

4. **At Large** - Farmers 4 through 25 will be selected randomly to win a 1.6TB [Intel® SSD DC P4610 Series](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/140103/intel-ssd-dc-p4610-series-1-6tb-2-5in-pcie-3-1-x4-3d2-tlc.html) Drive.

5. **The Top 25** farmers will all receive an OG Farmer 2020 T-shirt.

Some notes on these prizes. The Intel P4610 is U.2 NVMe so it will need an adapter for most consumer motherboards. The Samsung PM963 is an M.2 PCIe drive but is longer than usual length (110mm) and may need an adapter for a consumer motherboard. All items are brand new with manufacturer's warranties.

If any prize winner does not claim their prize we'll move all awards to the next eligible winner. Winners have 864 blocks to claim their prizes before we move on.

To win, you'll need to use the `chia keys sign/verify` command line tool. We will ask you to sign a message with the corresponding secret key so that we can be sure we're sending the prize to the actual winner. If any of the winning farmers don't get in contact with Chia by block 14,214 or choose to remain fully anonymous, we will move on to, for example, the number 2, 3, and 4 farmer for another 400 blocks and repeat until we have all prizes awarded. Chia company owned farms/plots and Chia employees and contractors are not eligible to win and any of these plots will be removed from the final count. You will contact either hello@chia.net or [@hoffmang on Keybase](https://keybase.io/hoffmang) to provide a method of contact (Keybase, Twitter or email) and a name and shipping address to claim your prize. We will also want to know a name or pseudonym that we can use to identify each winner in the contest results. In the very unlikely case of a tie between any two farmers, we will flip a coin in [Chia's #testnet Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public) chat to determine which farmer will be considered higher ranked. We will use the results of the block 13,400 VDF as our source of randomness to choose the At Large prize.

Anyone can participate except Chia employees, Chia Network Inc, and residents of Cuba, the Crimea territory, Iran, North Korea, Syria; residents of any country or state where participation is illegal, prohibited, restricted or subject to tax or registration under applicable local laws; and any person who is subject to sanctions, blocking or other denial lists under U.S. law, including, but not limited to, persons on the US Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
