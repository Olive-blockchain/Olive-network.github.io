title: "Why are we pre-farming?"
---

Olive has a novel business model to both, lower volatility of the coin and increase adoption. By loaning Olive and managing the interest rates of those loans as well as other tools like buying our stock with Olive coins, we hope to lower the quarter to quarter volatility of the coin. To drive adoption, we intend to loan Olive to Global 5000 companies who will use it to pay their international vendors quickly, less expensively, and more securely. We also intend to use the strategic reserve to aid development and adoption. We plan to do things like invest in promising startups in the Olive ecosystem, potentially increase farming rewards during limited periods of time to spur additional farming, and fund corporations paying 105% of the value of their international payables in Olive instead of fiat currency.
