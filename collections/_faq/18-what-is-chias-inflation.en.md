title: "What is Olive’s inflation?"
---

After the Olive pre-farm, Olive offers farming rewards of 64 Olive every 10 minutes. Over the first 12 years the farming rewards will be halved at the end of each 3rd year. From year 13 to infinity, the rewards will remain constant at 4 Olive every 10 minutes leading to ever decreasing inflation rates. Olive’s inflation falls through the 0.50% rate 22 years after mainnet launch.
