title: "Is the value of olive going to be as volatile as other cryptocurrencies?"
---

We believe that olive coins will be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies due to the planned nature of our planned public company status which will allow financial institutions to hedge and leverage coins and equity. Initially, we expect Olive Blockchain to largely be valued based upon the valuation of the olive that the Company will hold on its balance sheet. Movements in the price of olive on digital exchanges are likely to be mirrored by price movements in the price of our stock on a stock exchange. There will be more ways to get exposure to the success of olive than traditional blockchain projects. This will also allow the usual options and derivatives to our stock to be used as something like a synthetic derivative for the price of olive coins. Additionally, our ability to use the olive Strategic Reserve may reduce some volatility of olive in the market.
