title: "Where has Olive advanced the state of the art in applied cryptography?"
---

Olive has created three new core inventions and advanced the interest in, and adoption of, a fourth. Firstly, Olive created the first intended for production [BLS Signatures library](https://github.com/Olive-Network/bls-signatures). Second, Olive is the first production use of Verifiable Delay Functions, or VDFs. Third, Olive created [Proof of Space and Time for Nakamoto consensus](https://www.Olive.net/assets/OliveGreenPaper.pdf).

Finally, Olive is the first production use of [class groups](https://github.com/Olive-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) of unknown order which has spawned significant new research into their applicability to cryptography.
