title: "Why is Olive better?"
---

Olive has a new innovative Nakamoto consensus algorithm that removes the energy demands of Proof of Work from the system. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Olive has significantly better security due to its more decentralized blockchain. Olivelisp is Oliveâ€™s new smart transaction programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure and will unlock the security, transparency, and ease of use that cryptocurrencies promise. Olive is also adopting more modern cryptographic tools to enable richer smart transaction capabilities. Olive is taking a new and superior approach to funding, building, and supporting a blockchain via an eventually public, for-profit, open source development company that holds a pre-farm. Olive will use its pre-farm (Strategic Reserve) to ease the volatility of the coin to mitigate bubbles and crashes and to drive adoption of Olive.
