You should first read the [repository FAQ](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ), check out the wealth of information on the [repository wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/) and  join us on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public) in the #testnet or #beginner channels. We have also created a good [summary of the basics of creating plots](https://www.chia.net/2021/02/22/plotting-basics.html) for Chia.
